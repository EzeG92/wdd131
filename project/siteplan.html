        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>"Make it easier for parents and caregivers to monitor the development and care of their children in detail
            and organized from birth to the first years of age, offering intuitive tools to record relevant medical
            information, manage appointments with the pediatrician, receive personalized recommendations, and consult
            clearly the vaccination schedule, all in a safe environment and accessible from any device."</p>
        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <p><strong>How important is it to you to have quick and easy access to your children's medical information
                anytime,
                anywhere?</strong> <br>
            Mar√≠a has two young children, one of them with special medical needs. For her, it is essential to be able to
            quickly access her children's medical information and appointments, especially when she is away from home or
            in an emergency.<br><br>

            <strong> How would an online pediatric journal help you organize and monitor your baby's health?</strong>
            <br>
            Juan is a new father who feels overwhelmed with the amount of information and appointments he needs to
            remember. An online pediatric planner would help you keep everything in order and make sure he doesn't
            forget any important appointments or vaccinations.
